## Abstract
The utilization of seawater source heat pumps in coastal cities presents a promising approach to improve energy efficiency and mitigate the urban heat island effect. However, the pipeline system associated with these heat pumps often faces challenges related to bio-fouling, necessitating regular inspection and maintenance. To overcome these obstacles, we propose an innovative inspection solution based on Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicles (ROVs) specifically designed for the inner side of seawater cooling pipelines. Our solution integrates a Light Transformer-based image enhancement algorithm, effectively addressing the impaired image clarity caused by prevalent debris and air bubbles.

## USIM Dataset
UIEB includes two subsets: 890 raw underwater images with corresponding high-quality reference images. We will periodically update the results for noticeable underwater image enhancement methods. The USIM dataset is for non-commercial use only. Please enjoy the 890 raw underwater image and the corresponding reference images.
This USIM dataset is used only for academic purposes. The re-distribution of this dataset is forbidden!!! Here is the one and only download port. The infringement will be held responsible.
